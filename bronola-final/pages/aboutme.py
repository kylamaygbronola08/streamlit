                 "Envisioning 2034: My Journey of Growth and Fulfillment"
In 10 years, I see myself as a successful professional in Information Systems, using what I learned in my college years. I want to lead teams and projects at a well-respected company, 
                where I can help shape the future of tech solutions. I'm interested in areas like cybersecurity, building software, or data analysis, using new technologies to solve big problems.
                 As a leader, I want to create a team environment that encourages new ideas and working together, driving important plans that keep the company ahead of the competition. 
                I'm committed to always learning new things, staying up-to-date on the latest tech trends and best practices, so I can make a real difference to the company's success and contribute to the tech world as a whole.

I want to be a leader in the field of information technology (IT). But I also want to give back by helping others learn and grow. I've learned a lot in my own journey, and I want to inspire and guide new people, 
                especially those from groups not well-represented in tech, to join the industry. I also want to keep learning beyond my bachelor's degree, maybe by getting a master's degree or special training in specific IT areas. 
                Whether it's analyzing data or figuring out how to use technology to change things for the better, I'm committed to staying up-to-date and adapting as the tech world changes.

Finally, I want to find a healthy balance between my work goals, personal interests, and supporting my family, especially my parents. Outside of work, I want to stay active and involved in things that make me feel good, like fitness, travel, and helping others. 
                By taking care of myself in all these ways, I can stay creative, bounce back from challenges, and keep making a positive difference, both at work, in my personal life, and for my family, for the next ten years and beyond.
